# 1979. Find Greatest Common Divisor of Array

## Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums`, return *the greatest common divisor* of the smallest number and largest number in `nums`.

The **greatest common divisor** of two numbers is the largest positive integer that evenly divides both numbers.

### Example 1

Input: nums = [2,5,6,9,10]  
Output: 2  
Explanation: The smallest number is 2 and the largest number is 10. The greatest common divisor of 2 and 10 is 2.

### Example 2

Input: nums = [7,5,6,8,3]  
Output: 1  
Explanation: The smallest number is 3 and the largest number is 8. The greatest common divisor of 3 and 8 is 1.

### Example 3

Input: nums = [3,3]  
Output: 3  
Explanation: The smallest number is 3 and the largest number is 3. The greatest common divisor of 3 and 3 is 3.

### Constraints

- `2 <= nums.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
