# 238. Product of Array Except Self

## Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums`, return an array `answer` such that `answer[i]` is equal to the product of all the elements of `nums` except `nums[i]`.

The product of any prefix or suffix of `nums` is **guaranteed** to fit in a 32-bit integer.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time and without using the division operation.

### Example 1

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]  
Output: [24,12,8,6]

### Example 2

Input: nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]  
Output: [0,0,9,0,0]

### Constraints

- `2 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `-30 <= nums[i] <= 30`
- The product of any prefix or suffix of `nums` is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

### Follow up

- Can you solve the problem in `O(1)` extra space complexity (excluding the output array)?
