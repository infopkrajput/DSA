# 75. Sort Colors

## Problem Statement

Given an array `nums` with `n` objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them **in-place** so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

We will use the integers `0`, `1`, and `2` to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.

You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.

### Example 1

Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]  
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]

### Example 2

Input: nums = [2,0,1]  
Output: [0,1,2]

### Example 3

Input: nums = [0]  
Output: [0]

### Example 4

Input: nums = [1]  
Output: [1]

### Constraints

- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= n <= 300`
- `nums[i]` is either `0`, `1`, or `2`.

### Follow up

- Could you come up with a one-pass algorithm using only constant extra space?
